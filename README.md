# LAB2_SCV

## **TASK 1**

In this task we make use of the Exercici1.py python script which is able to extract 3 relevant data from the container of the bbbVideo.mp4 (that I did not uploaded in this project because it was bigger than 25MB).

## **TASK 2**

This task makes use of the Exercici2.py python script which is capable of cutting the BBB video to 1 minute video and then extract two separate audio traks, 1. mp3 stereo track and 2. audio in AAC with lower bitrate. Finally the script is able to merge the video with both audios.

## **TASK 3**

This task makes use of the Exercici3.py python script which is meant to resize any input given.

## **TASK 4**

This task makes use of the Exercici4.py python script which is able to check the audio tracks of the input video and then gives information about which broadcasting
standard will fit better with the input video.

## **TASK 5**

This task makes use of the Exercici5.py python script which is putting all other tasks together in a main function to be able to select one of the tasks to be runned in your system.

## Extra information

This repo is also containing some videos and images that could be useful when trying to run the python scripts. For example the '1min_cuttedVideo.mp4' is a 1 minute cutted video from the BBB original video. Then we also have the images 'image.jpg' and 'image.png' to take them as input parameters of the function defined in task 3 to resize these images (resized outputs using the function of task 3: 'outputImage.jpg' and 'outputImage.png'). We can also try to resize the 1min_cuttedVideo.mp4 as well, because the function works with all types of input files (output of the resized video outputVideo.mp4).

Then we have some text files such as 'info_ex1.txt' and 'info_ex4.txt' which are very helpful for task 1 and task 4, respectivelly, in order to be aware of the container information of the videos that we are using.

In addition, I have also added the output of the function used in task 2: 'output_ex2.mp4', together with the two extracted audio traks. The one in mp3 stereo format, 'stereo_track.mp3', and the one in aac and lower bitrate as 'aac_lowerBitrate.aac'.
